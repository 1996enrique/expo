title: Learning more
---

We tried to set expectations early on that this tutorial is more focused on _doing_ rather than _explaining_. Now that the doing is done, let's fill in the gaps on concepts that we applied.

## JavaScript features such as async/await, import, and others

Read about [Modern JavaScript on React Native Express](https://www.reactnative.express/javascript/features).

## React

We used React components and APIs here with little explanation. Having a solid understanding of React is essential to using Expo to build your app. We recommend reading the [Main Concepts section](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and the [Hooks section](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) of the React documentation.

## React Native

Expo provides tooling and libraries on top of a React Native app. While developing the tutorial app, we used React Native extensively. You can start from the [React Native basics guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox) to learn more or check out the following recommendations:

- [View API reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view)
- [Text API reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text)
- [Platform specific code](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code)
- [Presenting data in a list](https://reactnative.dev/docs/using-a-listview)

Flexbox is used to position and size the components on your screen, and implement layouts. Check out the following recommendations to learn more about it:

- [Height & Width](https://reactnative.dev/docs/height-and-width)
- [Layout with Flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox)

## Configuring your app with app.json

We covered the basic minimal configuration, but you learn more about customizing your [app icon](/guides/app-icons) and [splash screen](/guides/splash-screens) in their respective guides. Also, go through [app.json property reference](/workflow/configuration) for properties you can configure in this file.

## Topics that you will soon care about

### Standalone apps & deployment

How can you take what you have built and turn it into an app that you ship to the App Store and Play Store. Read more about [distributing your app to stores](/distribution/introduction) and [deploying websites](/distribution/publishing-websites).

### Navigation

We had one screen in the tutorial app. Most apps have multiple screens. Read more on how to add navigation to your app by following the [Fundamentals guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) in the React Navigation documentation.

### Debugging

Sometimes things go wrong, and when they do you need to use debugging tools to figure out where your code is having trouble. [Read more about debugging](/workflow/debugging).

### Gestures and Animations

To learn more about implementing different types of gestures and animations, we recommend:

- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/) documentation
- [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs) documentation
