title: Learning more
---

We tried to set expectations early on that this tutorial is more focused on _doing_ rather than _explaining_. Now that the doing is done, let's fill in the gaps on concepts that we applied.

## React

We used React components and APIs here with little explanation. Having a solid understanding of React is essential to using Expo to build your app. We recommend reading the [Main Concepts section](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and the [Hooks section](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) of the React documentation.

## async/await, import, and other JavaScript features

Read about [Modern JavaScript on React Native Express](https://www.reactnative.express/javascript/features).

## React Native

Expo provides tooling and libraries on top of a React Native app. While developing the tutorial app, we used React Native extensively.

You can start from the [React Native basics guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox) or check out the following recommendations:

### View and Text styles

Read through the [View API reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) and [Text API reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) in the React Native documentation.

### Flexbox

This is the way you position and size the components on your screen and implement layouts. Learn more about it in [Height & Width](https://reactnative.dev/docs/height-and-width) and [Layout with Flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox) in the React Native documentation.

## Configuring your app with app.json

We covered the basic minimal configuration, but you learn more about customizing your [app icon](/guides/app-icons) and [splash screen](/guides/splash-screens) in their respective guides. Learn more about other properties you can configure in [app.json property reference](/workflow/configuration).

### How to verify your Learning

- You will typically be referred back to **app.json** as part of guides that explain how to accomplish specific tasks, as such there isn't much you need to learn beyond its existence and how to use specific properties as the need arises.

# Topics that you will soon care about

## Standalone apps & deployment

How can you take what you have built and turn it into an app that you ship to the App Store and Play Store. Learn more about [distributing your app to stores](/distribution/introduction) and [deploying websites](/distribution/publishing-websites).

## Navigation

Most apps have multiple screens, we just have one here! Learn more about how to add navigation to your app by following the [Fundamentals guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) in the React Navigation documentation.

## Debugging

Sometimes things go wrong, and when they do you need to use debugging tools to figure out where your code is having trouble. [Read more about debugging](/workflow/debugging).

## Using the documentation

[Read more about how you can navigate this documentation and use it effectively](/next-steps/using-the-documentation).
