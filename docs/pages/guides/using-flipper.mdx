[Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) is a platform for debugging React Native projects running on an emulator/simulator or a physical device. It supports projects running on Android and iOS platforms, and is available as a desktop application on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

It offers various features such as a device log viewer, interactive native layout inspector, network inspector, local database inspector, crash reporter and more. You can add more plugins available in the Flipper desktop app.

Debugging your Expo projects with Flipper requires the following:

- An Expo project created with [Development Build](/development/introduction/)
- [`expo-community-flipper` Config Plugin](https://github.com/jakobo/expo-community-flipper)

> **info** The `expo-community-flipper` is based on [Expo's Config plugin](/guides/config-plugins/), which is a system that allows changing Expo config to use native code in your Expo project automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- [Flipper desktop app](https://fbflipper.com/)
- [EAS CLI installed](/build/setup/#1-install-the-latest-eas-cli) and [logged in](/build/setup/#2-log-in-to-your-expo-account) to your Expo account

## Step 1: Run Setup Doctor in Flipper app

Open the Flipper desktop app and click the **Setup Doctor** button from the bottom left menu. This is necessary to ensure that all required dependencies are installed correctly on your computer.

/>

If any required dependency is missing, follow the instructions provided by Flipper in the desktop app to install it.

## Step 2: Install expo-dev-client

Since Flipper integration depends on native code, you'll need to create a Development Build. To set it up, you'll need to install the `expo-dev-client` library in your project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

## Step 3: Install expo-community-flipper

The `expo-community-flipper` plugin depends on the `react-native-flipper` library. Run the following command to install both of them:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-community-flipper react-native-flipper']} />

## Step 4: Add the Config Plugin

In the **app.json**, add `expo-community-flipper` to the `plugins` array:

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": ["expo-community-flipper"]
}
```

## Step 5: Configure the Development Build

> **info** If you have already configured EAS and a build profile, you can skip this step. Make sure to run the build command to apply changes from `expo-community-flipper` plugin to your Development Build.

To configure a Development Build for your project, you'll need to set up EAS with a Debug build. To set up EAS, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build:configure']} />

It generates **eas.json** in your project and allows setting up a build profile.

The `"development"` build profile in **eas.json** is already created. Add the `android.buildType` property to generate a **.apk** for an Android device or emulator. To test your project on the iOS simulator, add the `ios.simulator` property to the build profile.

An example of a build profile with the configuration mentioned above is shown below:

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      },
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also create a custom build profile to use Flipper integration. For more information, see [Build Profiles](/build/eas-json/#build-profiles).

After you have configured the build profile, run the following command to build the project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --profile development --platform all']} />

Once the build is complete, you can download it from the build page in the [Expo Dashboard](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/builds) of your account and install it on your device or emulator/simulator.

## Step 6: Run the development server

Run the following command to trigger the development server:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo --dev-client']} />

Once the development server is running, open the Flipper desktop app and select your device or simulator under **App Inspect**:

## Limitations

In your project, if a third-party library uses `"useFrameworks": "static"` for iOS, integrating Flipper will not work since it is incompatible. For more information, see the [notice on the compatibility issue](https://github.com/jakobo/expo-community-flipper/issues/27) in the `expo-community-flipper` GitHub repository.
